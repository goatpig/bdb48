addendum: (August 15, 2023)

- Fixed a compilation issue with modern gcc (simple rename to avoid
  name clash in dbinc/atomic.h:179)
- Added a dockerfile to build a ubuntu base image with bdb 4.8 built
  and installed in /usr/lib, for the purpose of build bitcoin core and/or
  elements from that image.
